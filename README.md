## Project Overview

## Organization
- **Organization:** Government of Rajasthan
- **Department:** Directorate of Technical Education (DTE)
- **Problem Statement ID:** SIH25103

## Problem Statement
Currently, admissions, fee collection, hostel allocation, and examination records are maintained in separate ledgers. This leads to several issues:
- Students have to queue at multiple counters.
- Staff must re-enter identical data across different systems.
- Administrators lack a real-time institutional overview.

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is an integrated workflow where:
- Admission data flows seamlessly into a central student database.
- Financial transactions automatically generate digital receipts.
- Hostel and library records update the same database in real-time.
- Summary dashboards present key metrics to administrators using widely available software services rather than proprietary, hardware-intensive solutions.
